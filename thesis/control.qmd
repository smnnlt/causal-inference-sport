<!-- ### Identification of variables to Condition on -->

#| fig-cap: "A graphical example of M bias. $C$ is caused by both $A$ and $B$, which also effect $X$ and $Y$, respectively. In this scenario, a non-causal path exists, but it is closed, because $C$ is a collider. When $C$ is conditioned on, this would open the backdoor path, because the conditiong creates a spurious relationship between $X$ and $Y$, so that both act together as a confounder."

dag_mbias <- dagify(X ~ A, C ~ A + B, Y ~ X + B)
coordinates(dag_mbias) <- list(x = c(X = 0, A = 0, C = 0.5, B = 1, Y = 1), y = c(X = 0, A = 1, B = 1, C = 0.5, Y = 0))

<!-- Even in RCT. Which variables to include/exclude in the statistical analyses. Potential problems with current approaches (all, random, all significant, none).  -->

<!-- refer to economics theory of conditioning on all pre-treatment variables. M-Bias as counterarguments, but m-bias is rather unrealistic -->

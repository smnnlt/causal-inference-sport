# Introduction

## Background

<!-- Distinction between associations and causal relations -->

<!-- Define causality. -->

<!-- Why is it important to find causal relations in sport science -->

<!-- Why can't we say a relation is causal simply based on associations -->

<!-- Methods are available to identify causal relationships, they combine a theoretical scientific model with empirical data. This is causal inference. -->

## Previous Research

<!-- Short history of causal inference. -->

<!-- Popular tools of causal inference: e.g., DAGs -->

<!-- Causal Inference in applied sciences: psychology, economics, ecology... -->

<!-- Causality in sport science (basically no research yet) -->

## Aim

<!-- 1.  Introduce methods of causal inference based to sport science -->
<!-- 2.  Demonstrate their utility on example data -->
<!-- 3.  Construct potential causal models for future research in sport science -->
<!-- 4.  Discuss limitations and challenges of causal inference in sports -->

<!-- Goal: Make it as accessible as possible. Mathematical background and notation only in the appendix. Easy to understand examples. Work with simulations and real (toy) data. -->

<!-- This thesis ... State main finding and introduce structure of discussion -->

## General Applications of Causal Inference in Sport Science

### Causality in Observational Data

<!-- RCT often impossible. Especially in elite sports (hard to do experiments) or when it comes to explaining sport performance (no direct manipulation of predictors possible). -->


### Identification of variables to Condition on

#| fig-cap: "A graphical example of M bias. $C$ is caused by both $A$ and $B$, which also effect $X$ and $Y$, respectively. In this scenario, a non-causal path exists, but it is closed, because $C$ is a collider. When $C$ is conditioned on, this would open the backdoor path, because the conditiong creates a spurious relationship between $X$ and $Y$, so that both act together as a confounder."

dag_mbias <- dagify(X ~ A, C ~ A + B, Y ~ X + B)
coordinates(dag_mbias) <- list(x = c(X = 0, A = 0, C = 0.5, B = 1, Y = 1), y = c(X = 0, A = 1, B = 1, C = 0.5, Y = 0))

p_mbias <- ggdag_classic(dag_mbias, size = 15) + theme_dag_blank()

<!-- Even in RCT. Which variables to include/exclude in the statistical analyses. Potential problems with current approaches (all, random, all significant, none).  -->

<!-- refer to economics theory of conditioning on all pre-treatment variables. M-Bias as counterarguments, but m-bias is rather unrealistic -->

## Applicability of Special Causal Inference Methods in Sports

### Instrumental Variables

### Regression Discontinuity

### Difference-in-difference

### Synthetic Control

## Challenges and Limitations

### Need for Theoretical Models

<!-- causal inference need causal models. They are subjective. They are hard to prove or disprove. They rely on scientific consensus. -->

<!-- however all science implicitly relies on these. With causal inference they are just explicitly formalized, making it easier to discuss them and understand their implications. -->

### Complex Systems

<!-- all causal models are a simplification of the reality, which can not be adequately portrayed. DAGs can miss many variables and possible relations, so caution is needed. -->

<!-- however the only way to understand complex systems is model them in restricted environments or simpler form. To ultimately infer in them, we need to understand their structure, often not in detail, but the most important aspects. This is what causal modeling aims to provide. -->

### Small Samples

### Data Quality

<!-- Even a correct model can not answer the questions if it has the wrong data. Incorrect or noisy data limits research, and causal inference can not really help here. Sometimes no perfect model exists. -->

<!-- causal inference can not compensate bad experimental design -->

<!-- however this is an issue for all types of analysis. Causal inference has tools to deal with error and missingness of data -->

## Perspectives and Further Possibilities

### Modeling Missing Data and Measurement Error

<!-- maybe measurement error in VO2max or RPE as proxy of motivation -->

<!-- link to imputation -->

<!-- sampling bias? -->

### Heterogenous Effects

### Longitudinal Data

<!-- DAGs are fixed in time. Can be used for longitudinal data if time-points are separate notes. Make example of exercise intervention. Maybe SEM /Robins DAG as an alternative -->

### Understanding Big Data

<!-- Large amount data. Currently analyzed with ML and traditional LR. May be good for prediction, but often does not help understanding. Even for prediction tasks understanding is vital. Understand why a model is failing in some cases, how a system works in new environments, and how to actually interfere. -->

<!-- Maybe (Hypothetical) example of predicting marathon performance with training data -->

### Communicating Causality

<!-- something about causal and non-causal language, stating assumptions, etc -->

<!-- maybe sometimes to confident usage of causal inference -->

<!-- but more explicit with assumptions than current practices -->

## Causal Modeling Workflows in Sport Science Practice

<!-- Implementation of causal modeling is part of a general revision of the scientific workflow in sport science. Transparent documentation of all steps (links to preregistration, reproducibility) -->

<!-- combining expert domain knowledge (expertise) for creating models and outside domain knowledge (data analysis skills/statistics) -->

<!-- First: Identify task as description, prediction, causal inference -->
<!-- Second: State your estimand (and create a theoretical model, implement prior beliefs) -->
<!-- Third: Plan study or data analysis accordingly-->
<!-- Fourth: Model the data accordingly -->
<!-- Test assumptions, robustness, sensitivity -->
<!-- Communicate process, results and assumptions -->

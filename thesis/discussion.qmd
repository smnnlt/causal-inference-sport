# Discussion

<!-- This thesis ... State main finding and introduce structure of discussion -->

## Applications in Sport Science

### Causality in Observational Data

<!-- RCT often impossible. Especially in elite sports (hard to do experiments) or when it comes to explaining sport performance (no direct manipulation of predictors possible). -->

### Identification of Confounders

<!-- Even in RCT. Which variables to include/exclude in the statistical analyses. Potential problems with current approaches (all, random, all significant, none).  -->

### Understanding Big Data

<!-- Large amount data. Currently analyzed with ML and traditional LR. May be good for prediction, but often does not help understanding. Even for prediction tasks understanding is vital. Understand why a model is failing in some cases, how a system works in new environments, and how to actually interfere. -->

<!-- Maybe (Hypothetical) example of predicting marathon performance with training data -->

### Study Design

<!-- which (confounding) variables to measure, can the causal question aimed for be answered with the design. -->

### Altenative Realities with potential outcomes.

<!-- something with potential outcomes, but need to find an example -->

## Challenges and Limitations

### Need for Theoretical Models

<!-- causal inference need causal models. They are subjective. They are hard to prove or disprove. They rely on scientific consensus. -->

<!-- however all science implicitly relies on these. With causal inference they are just explicitly formalized, making it easier to discuss them and understand their implications. -->

### Data Quality

<!-- Even a correct model can not answer the questions if it has the wrong data. Incorrect or noisy data limits research, and causal inference can not really help here. Sometimes no perfect model exists. -->

<!-- however this is an issue for all types of analysis. Causal inference has tools to deal with error and missingness of data -->

### Complex Systems

<!-- all causal models are a simplification of the reality, which can not be adequately portrayed. DAGs can miss many variables and possible relations, so caution is needed. -->

<!-- however the only way to understand complex systems is model them in restricted environments or simpler form. To ultimately infer in them, we need to understand their structure, often not in detail, but the most important aspects. This is what causal modeling aims to provide. -->

### Communicating Causality

<!-- something about causal and non-causal language, stating assumptions, etc -->

## Perspectives and Further Possibilities

### Modeling Unobserved Variables, Missing Data, and Measurement Error

<!-- maybe measurement error in VO2max or RPE as proxy of motivation -->

### Sampling and Survivorship Bias

<!-- example: running economy and Vo2max. Apparent negative relationship in elite runners. May stem from sampling bias (good runners are good in either one or the other) -->

### Longitudinal Data

<!-- DAGs are fixed in time. Can be used for longitudinal data if time-points are separate notes. Make example of exercise intervention. Maybe SEM as an alternative -->

### Causal Modeling Workflows in Sport Science Practice

<!-- Implementation of causal modeling is part of a general revision of the scientific workflow in sport science. Link to preregistration, reproducibility -->

<!-- combining expert domain knowledge (expertise) for creating models and outside domain knowledge (data analysis skills/statistics) -->

<!-- First: Identify task as description, prediction, causal inference -->
<!-- Second: State your estimand (and create a theoretical model) -->
<!-- Third: Plan study or data analysis accordingly -->
<!-- Fourth: Model the data accordingly -->
<!-- Test assumptions, robustness -->
<!-- Communicate process, results and assumptions -->

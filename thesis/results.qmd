## Example 1: Use of Different Running Shoes and Injury Risk

In running, overuse injuries occur frequently [@lopes2012]. As the feet transmit all ground forces, running shoes have been the focus of many injury prevention strategies [@sun2020]. A common belief coming from running practice is that parallel use of different shoes increases movement variability and decreases injury risk, but the scientific evidence for this is limited [@vanmechelen1992].

@malisoux2015 tested the claim that concomitant use of running shoes decreases injury risks in an observational study. Using a prospective cohort design, they followed a group of 264 runners training for a marathon and documented their anthropometrics, training characteristics, shoe use, and injury occurrence. @malisoux2015 categorized runners into multi-shoe and single-shoe users, where multi-shoe users were those who reported to have changed running shoes at least twice between training sessions over the observation period. The authors fit several Cox proportional hazard regressions to the data[^1]. Using a semi-automated parameter selection, they finally arrived at a multivariate ("adjusted") model, with the coefficients indicating that multiple-shoe users had indeed a lower injury risk.

[^1]: Cox regression is a popular regression tool for survival analysis. In short, the survival rate over time depending on one or more covariates is modeled. In this case, being non-injured over a given amount of training volume was compared between the group of multiple shoe and single shoe users [@malisoux2015].

The study by @malisoux2015 was clearly causal in its aim. The title 'Can parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?' poses a causal question, the hypothesis is of causal nature, the authors discuss 'protective factors', speculate about potential causal mechanism of their findings, and state that multiple shoe use 'could be advised to recreational runners to prevent running-related injuries'. However they acknowledge the low statistical power of their study and suggest that larger and longer observational studies, or randomized controlled trials should be conducted to confirm their findings. I will here revisit the study by @malisoux2015 from a causal inference perspective.

The inherent drawback of the observational study by @malisoux2015 is the lack of randomization. The conditions of single or multiple shoe use are not randomly assigned to a runner, but are chosen by them (though implicit, as the research goal was not communicated in advance). When treatment conditions are chosen instead of randomly assigned this can introduce bias when estimating causal effects of the treatment. Essentially, in this case the assignment to a condition is likely not independent of the (projected) outcomes. Confounders may bias the causal relationship between treatment and outcome. An indicator of this might be the group imbalances in the pre-treatment variables seen in Table 1 of @malisoux2015. Multiple shoe users were on average older and had more regular training and racing in the year before the study. While some baseline imbalances are natural even in the case of randomization, this pattern indicates that some variables potentially had an influence in the choice of using multiple running shoes, and these variables are confounders if they also have an effect on injury risk as the outcome variable.

@malisoux2015 are aware of the potential impact of confounders. This is why they do not directly interpret bivariate analyses of any variable with injury risk, but provide an "adjusted" multivariate model. This model is used to estimate the effect of parallel running shoe usage on injury risk, while controlling for confounders. However, not only the coefficient of running shoe use, but also the other coefficients of the final model are interpreted in a causal way (e.g., the participation in sports other than running). The direct causal interpretation of multiple coefficients from multivariate models has been called the "Table 2 fallacy" and it is generally regarded as bad statistical practice [@westreich2013]. Moreover when no preregistration was done, this practice may invite researchers to present post-hoc hypothesis as a priori [@kerr1998]. Even if only the primary causal effect of interest is considered, the final model by @malisoux2015 is likely to provide a biased estimate. The "adjusted" model is chosen by first performing a bivariate screening of all available variables and then an automatic selection procedure on a subset of these (with two variables manually included). In the methodological literature, bivariate screening is generally advised against, while automated variable selection is highly debatable [@sun1996]. Current best advice is to use background knowledge when selecting appropriate variables [@heinze2018] and if this is not sufficient at least use regularization methods [e.g., @fan2002].

Another potential source of bias is hidden in the definition of the treatment variable in @malisoux2015. Multiple shoe users are defined by a minimum number of two shoe changes over the observation period. There may be a direct dependence between this grouping criterion and the outcome variable (non-injuredness the over observation period): On the one hand, athletes who receive an injury subsequently drop out of the study and thus have less time to accumulate shoe changes for being categorized as multiple-shoe users. Potentially, athletes would be considered multiple-shoe users if they had trained for a longer time instead of receiving an injury. On the other hand, people who dropped out of the study were, after a check, considered as non-injured. These athletes had less time to accumulate shoe changes and may have been more likely to be characterized as single shoe users. In both ways a non-causal relationship between the particular definition of shoe use and injury may exist. A way to check this source of bias and aid the causal interpretation of the study would be to give information on the observation duration, possible in form of a survival curve [@kaplan1958]. Directly modeling drop-out or testing the robustness of the model by using the momentarily instead the retrospective group assignment may be a statistical way to deal with these potential biases.

A popular way to reduce bias by non-random assignment to groups is matching [@ho2007]. In this example, if we assume that certain variables influence the outcome of injury and the treatment variable of shoe use, we may compare only those single and multiple shoes users that share similar values for covariates. One common matching method is propensity score matching [@rosenbaum1983; @dehejia2002]. It works by first modeling the conditional probability to be assigned to one of the treatment groups with a logistic regression. Then the results of this regression model — the propensity scores — are conditioned on in the actual statistical model [typically in form of inverse probability weighting, see @busso2014]. This ensures that only individuals who were equally likely to be assigned to a treatment group will be compared in the analysis of the causal treatment effect. While propensity score matching is commonly used in many disciplines, it has received heavy criticism in the context of matching [@king2019].

Taken together, from a causal inference viewpoint the results by @malisoux2015 should be questioned. The study could benefit from the discussion of an underlying causal model (e.g., in form of a DAG) and the use statistical methods to deal with non-randomized group assignment (e.g., propensity score-based weighting). At a minimum, the definition of multiple shoe use should be rechecked and survival curves should be included in the analysis. Finally, the rather small sample size (low absolute number of injuries occurred) will lead to imprecise estimates even if unbiasedness can be assumed. Therefore I agree with @malisoux2015, that either RCTs or larger observational studies should be conducted, if the research question is of enough relevance. I would just add that appropriate causal inference methods could help in all of these cases.
